Located in northern Myanmar, the small town of Putao is surrounded by ice-capped mountains and presents a unique vegetation, including rare orchids, as well as endemic birds and animals. This diverse ecosystem is celebrated in the new Biodiversity Education Center Putao, which opened its doors to the public in December 2019.
The centerpiece of the renovated space is a wooden box, which houses the ‘valueables’ of the museum, much like a jewelry box. The box is referencing a local construction technique, made by stacking wood planks in an angle, while its inside displays rare animals from the area. The elevated timber floor raises the eye of the observer to the box and the information boards that are framing the space. The circulation in the room follows a U-shape, along which visitors can learn about the natural resources of the area, its biodiversity and cultural heritage, as well as ongoing activities and initiatives related to the natural environment. A small sitting area in front of the box can offer the visitor a moment of rest and contemplation before they exit the museum.  
By merging local materials and techniques with new ideas and contemporary visions, this center becomes a new landmark in the heart of Putao, and offers a space of learning and awareness for locals and visitors, who can appreciate the natural beauty of their environments.
